Multimedia Project 2: Music Information Retrieval

A python program used librosa for MMIR and tested feature extraction and similarity metrics against a dataset comprised of 900 musics, provided with the project statement. Some of the MMIR algorithms were also implemented as an exercise, and the respective code is present in the repository.

This project was developed in the scope of the Multimedia course of the 3rd year of the Bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering from the University of Coimbra.
